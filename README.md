# Build Modern Next 14 Server Side App with Server Actions, Infinite Scroll & Framer Motion Animations


Anime Project is a modern Next.js server-side application that showcases the usage of server actions, infinite scroll, and Framer Motion animations. This project aims to provide a practical guide on leveraging Next.js features to build responsive web applications with enhanced user experiences.

Server actions are functions that run on the server but can be called from client-side components like any other JavaScript function. They are a way to encapsulate business logic and data fetching on the server without creating separate API routes.
Server actions are created using the "use server" flag.

Benefits of using server actions:

- **Less code**: Server actions require less code compared to API routes.
  
- **Improved developer experience**: By directly focusing on the business logic, developers can ship code faster.
  
- **Less client-side code**: Server actions can help reduce the amount of code that needs to be shipped to the client, which can improve performance.
  
- **SEO benefits**: Server actions can improve SEO by allowing more content to be pre-rendered on the server.

## Features

- **Server Actions**: Utilize server actions in Next.js to manage server-side logic efficiently, abstracting away the complexity of setting up separate API routes.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Implement infinite scroll functionality to dynamically load content as users scroll, providing a seamless browsing experience.
- **Framer Motion Animations**: Integrate Framer Motion animations to add engaging visual effects and enhance user interactions.
